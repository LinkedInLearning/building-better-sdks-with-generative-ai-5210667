# Challenge: Using Copilot on your OpenAPI spec

This is the challenge for using your OpenAPI specification to generate a first draft of your SDK. Use your OpenAPI specification to create an SDK that:

- Creates a set of classes to address some portion of your API
- Uses the language of your choice
- Leverages common libraries for authentication and http requests
- Adheres to your coding standards
- And includes detailed descriptions of the methods and individual parameters
