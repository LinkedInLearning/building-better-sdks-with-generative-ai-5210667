# Solution: Using Copilot on your OpenAPI spec

For my own testing, I used the Twilio OpenAPI Specification for their messages endpoint: https://github.com/twilio/twilio-oai/blob/main/spec/json/twilio_messaging_v1.json 

Create PHP classes for this OpenAPI specification for every endpoint and function that follow the PEAR coding standards. Also include PHP docblocks to describe the functions using the endpoint and parameter descriptions from the OpenAPI spec

And hereâ€™s another version for Python:

Create Python classes for this OpenAPI specification for every endpoint and function that follow the PEP-8 coding standards. Also include PEP-8 docblocks to describe the functions using the endpoint and parameter descriptions from the OpenAPI spec
