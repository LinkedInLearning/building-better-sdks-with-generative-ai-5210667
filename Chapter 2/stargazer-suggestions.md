Here are three ways you can improve the structure, clarity, or security of your code:

1. Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Information: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API tokens directly in your code. Instead, use environment variables to store such information securely.

2. Add Error Handling: Improve error handling to provide more informative error messages and handle different types of HTTP errors gracefully.

3. Refactor Repeated Code: Refactor repeated code into helper methods to improve code clarity and reduce redundancy.
