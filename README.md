## Course Description

Programmers use software development kits (SDKs) to leverage their web application programming interfaces (APIs) across dozens of projects while a much smaller core group creates those SDKs. Despite often being an afterthought, SDKs serve as the front door for many APIs giving developers their first impression and understanding of a product and can make or break a project. Instead of treating SDKs as a chore, this course explores how to use generative AI tools to create better, more useful, and well-structured SDKs for your API. Get hands-on experience as instructor Keith Casey lays out the basics of multiple generative AI models and shows you how to use them, how to evaluate their output, and how to incorporate AI into your workflow.
